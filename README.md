# Covid Economic Dashboard
This project was to showcase the volatility in the economy and how Covid-19 has directly affected the economy of Malaysia since the start of the pandemic. Stock prices of public listed companies were tracked during the period of this pandemic in various sectors. It was a simple project to practice my data engineering skills.
